# gabor-synthesis-flow
Educational digital synthesis flow tool inspired by academic teaching, demonstrating analyze, elaborate, generic (GTECH) logic, technology mapping, and timing analysis using Verilog, Liberty, and SDC constraints.
This tool was developed using Python with the assistance of AI-based coding tools.
The overall architecture, synthesis flow design, scope definition, and technical decisions were directed and validated by the author.
The project reflects the author’s understanding of digital synthesis flows rather than a production-grade synthesis engine.

# Instructions for using the tool
Download all the files in this branch. Gabor_synthsis.py is the main file. I will provide a description and a small tool flow introduction later. Thank you for your time.
